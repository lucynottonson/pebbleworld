      <p>when i get around to it i will tell a sweet little bedtime story followed by a description of various methods for curing insomnia. none of these methods work and as i write this i cannot sleep. i will likely never be able to sleep one hundred percent of the time but it has gotten better and the answers have to be somewhere and someone has to know something and one day i will know. you have to keep repeating those things to yourself when you start to get scared, guys. this is sort of my religion in a way. this is my faith. the more time passed the more i struggle to believe this but i know if i stop the world ends and its all hopeless and theres no reason to do anything or bother doing anything. i imagine thats why we all turn to various religons. when i say religion i mean that very loosely. i mean the thing that even the most devout athiest still has and must still have in order to keep himself from suicide and intellectual collapse. the athiest is still religious. we are religious creatures. if you think at all you will be led to some sort of religion. we all need something to have faith in. when i find out that there are no answers, or when the existence of possible answers stops being sufficient, i will need something else or i know i will die. but for now there are more answers and i believe this and reciting this to myself is my prayer. one day i will find out how to cure insomnia and when that day comes i will let everyone know. it is now three am and i am going to try again. if i fail i will not add anything because i will have much bigger problems at that point.</p>
