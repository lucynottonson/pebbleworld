          <p>
            I thought that this would be an appropriate and fun starting point for "Why Things are Good and Bad," as this title invokes probably the most recognizable and widely used binary.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since this is the first Why Things are Good and Bad (WTAGB) page, and because there are so many variations of the good/bad binary, I will start by specifically clarifying what I mean by "good" and "bad."
          </p>

          <p>
            Firstly, note that here, things are good AND bad as opposed to being good OR bad.
          </p>

          <p>
            I do not believe that anything is purely good or purely bad, except (one could argue) that the concepts of pure goodness and pure badness are definitionally and therefore necessarily purely good and purely bad.
          </p>

          <p>
            After enough thinking about the implications of binary thinking, it is easy to decide that they are conceptually limiting and perhaps oppressive in many scenarios. We might, ironically, decide that binaries are "bad."
          </p>

          <p>
            In response to this, many thinkers and cultural discourses attempt to move beyond binaries by reframing them as spectrums. A common way of deconstructing a binary is to replace it with a spectrum where the binary is spread out across a linear plane whose endpoints are what were previously the two sides of the binary. By doing this, something can be described as existing not as one of two opposites, but somewhere along a continuous range between them.
          </p>

          <p>
            The problem with this approach is that it still requires the binary to exist in the first place. In order to create a spectrum between two points, those two points must exist. Because of this, any proposed linear spectrum between two opposites is still a binary in many respects. It could be described as a soft binary, or a flexible binary.
          </p>

          <p>
            To say that things are both good <em>and</em> bad, however, is not to say they exist somewhere along a spectrum of good and bad. It's simply to utilize the fact that the concepts "good" and "bad" refer to something we all intuitively recognize. In Zoomer terms, "good" is sort of just a vibe.
          </p>

          <p>
            Insisting that each term be explicitly defined before it can be talked about doesn't deepen anyone's understanding, and in some ways, doing this seems to undermine, or at least misunderstand, the purpose and function of language. The "true" meanings of words exist in our collective understanding. Language is fluid, adaptive, and socially informed.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is extremely difficult, and perhaps impossible, to imagine a world without language. Language has such a meaningful impact on our perception of reality that it seems just as likely that reality is shaped entirely by language as that language developed in response to reality. The two are impossible to untangle.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before language, was the world an undifferentiated blur? Do our pets, who lack language, perceive everything as one continuous field with no boundaries between self and surroundings? I don't know. It's an interesting question. Regardless, reality technically remains singular. The purpose of language is to divide reality into pieces so that we can think about it better.
          </p>

          <p>
            A good way to understand this is to compare language to digital color. In real life, there are (technically) infinitely many colors. Color exists on a continuous spectrum, and our eyes and brains interpret wavelengths, lighting conditions, and context. What we call a "color" is not a fixed property but an experience that can vary endlessly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Digitally, however, there are not infinite colors. Depending on the quality of your screen you might be able to see anywhere from sixteen million to about a billion colors. A computer simulates the continuous color spectrum by dividing it into discrete values. These values create the illusion of lighting, perspective, and depth, and our brains fill in the rest. This creates an illusion of continuity even when it is not actually there.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is exactly what language does with reality. We divide the continuous, seamless whole of existence into discrete pieces and then put them back together. In doing this, a conceptual, second reality emerges. This symbolic world both distorts and reflects the original.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here we arrive at a crucial concept: the description of something is not the thing itself. The conceptual existence of an object or idea is only a reference to it, never its true existence.
          </p>

          <p>
            If I claim that the sky is blue, your counterargument shouldn't depend on redefining "the sky." Without that shared definition, we're not even talking about the same thing. But notice how the word "is" already traps us in definition. What does it mean to say something "is" blue? In reality, nothing "is" anything else. When we talk about things, and when we argue with each other about them, we are not talking about those things themselves but a conceptual approximation of them.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is why endlessly asking "what is good?" will eventually collapse under its own recursion. Questions like this misunderstand the relationship between words and reality. To ask what something "really is" assumes that reality is divided into discrete parts with set definitions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The conceptual world created by language, however, is not any less meaningful or important than the physical world. In fact, it is the only world we really have access to. It is the only world we can share. Anything that exists in our conceptual world might as well exist in the real world. The way we see reality is our reality, regardless of whatever "true" reality might exist beneath our perception of it.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am pointing this out specifically within the context of binaries because although we might be inclined to say that binaries do not actually exist, the fact of the matter is that they do exist because we have conceived of them. The concept of opposites is crucial to the construction of English and many other languages. Therefore, in our conceptual world, binaries exist.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some words mean, definitionally, the opposite of another word and nothing more. The word "or" itself exists to place a boundary between concepts. Our language, at least, seems deeply intertwined with binary thought.
          </p>

          <p>
            Is this a necessary part of language? I don't know. Probably not, I would say. Are binaries good? Do we need them?
          </p>

          <p>
            I'd imagine that you could describe the world in terms of what it is without ever referring to what it is not. I do not see any reason to assume that binary thought emerged out of necessity or that it was inevitable given the conditions of reality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another problem with binaries is what is commonly referred to as horseshoe theory. It is often the case that opposites resemble each other more than they resemble other things. So what even is an opposite? What is the purpose of this conceptual lens?
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't actually know. I'll probably end a lot of these essays the same way: I'm good at asking questions and being confused; I'm bad at generating answers.
          </p>

          <p>
            My prediction is that binaries are directly linked to capitalism, which is directly linked to the transatlantic slave trade. Binary thought gives us a conceptual framework for separation: self from other, subject versus object, person versus property. It's more convenient, less nuanced, and easier to maintain systems of power when the world is divided into neat categories.
          </p>

          <p>
            Importantly, binaries allow us to create false realities where it is not morally reprehensible to knowingly cause suffering. In order to assign monetary value to something, it must first be categorized. Capitalism depends on exploitation, which depends on dehumanization. Binary thought allows us to cognitively separate ourselves from the suffering of others, creating ideal conditions for exploitation.
          </p>

          <p>
            So are binaries bad? I think so. I understand that in order to answer that question I had to think in terms of binaries. But when I say "bad" here, I mean "causing harm," "lazy," "antithetical to human progress," or anything similar you might prefer. I do not mean "bad" in the sense of "opposite of good."
          </p>

          <p>
            My intention when I decided to write about why things are good and bad was to discover nuance. It is a good exercise against binary thinking to force both ends of a binary onto something. If two opposites both apply, the binary dissolves. It is no longer relevant. It does not explain anything. I am still using the terms because they mean something within our current conceptual reality. So I will attempt with each topic to generate reasons why things are both "good" and "bad."
          </p>

          <p>
            So how are binaries good? I don't know that I can say with any evidence that they are morally good, but if we replace "good" with "useful" or "advantageous for survival" we can generate some answers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our brains evolved to categorize for survival reasons. In a life-threatening situation, a predetermined categorization can be life-saving. Take snakes, for example: they're long and scaly and generally look like snakes. Some things that are not snakes may be quickly categorized as snakes by my brain if they meet this criteria. That tendency is adaptive—it's safer to mistake a stick for a snake than to mistake a snake for a stick. In the snake example, being able to quickly identify whether something is a snake translates directly to quickly identifying whether something is dangerous. "Dangerous versus safe" is therefore a crucial binary for survival.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is easy to see how quick survival decisions could have led to binary language. In a group, saying "dangerous" out loud is much quicker than describing the animal in detail, which might take too long if someone needed to react. But is this really the same type of binary as "right versus wrong"? Not necessarily.
          </p>

          <p>
            It sort of seems like binaries become problematic when we apply them to non-survival situations. I want to clarify that I do not believe evolutionary survival mechanisms are an adequate defense of human behavior outside of survival contexts. We have differentiated ourselves from other animals via language and complex moral reasoning. If that difference is real, we should rarely defend actions by appealing to natural instincts. We have created new systems of meaning, and it's our responsibility to adjust them when they cause harm. Humans also evolved reasoning capabilities that allow nonviolent problem-solving. So this argument often turns on itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            I actually think that applying a binary to binary thought is harmful in the same way binaries are. There are many useful applications of binaries. It's just as simplistic to say "binaries are always bad" as it is to defend binaries solely on evolutionary grounds.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have reached the point I feared when starting this project: there are too many things, too many perspectives, and many things can be true at once. I have no single answer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thinking for the sake of thinking is valuable. There does not have to be an answer or a conclusion. Living like this can be a small rebellion against capitalism: think long and hard without demanding a productive outcome, and allow the time spent thinking to be meaningful on its own.
          </p>

          <p>
            That's all I have for now. I am not necessarily pleased—this hasn't solved the questions I introduced at the beginning, nor do I feel closer to them. That was to be expected. I also live with severe OCD and other challenges, which complicate this process. But at least I finished something.
