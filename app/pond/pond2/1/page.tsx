          I thought that this would be an appropriate and fun starting point for &quot;Why Things are Good and Bad,&quot; as this title invokes probably the most recognizable and widely used binary.
        </p>    
 <p>
          Since this is the first Why Things are Good and Bad (WTAGB) page, and because there are so many variations of the good/bad binary, I will start by specifically clarifying what I mean by &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad.&quot;
       </p>
      <p>
          Firstly, note that here, things are good AND bad as opposed to being good OR bad.
 </p>




 <p>
          I do not believe that anything is purely good or purely bad, except (one could argue) that the concepts of pure goodness and pure badness are definitionally and therefore necessarily purely good and purely bad. Sure.
       </p>
 <p>
After enough thinking about the implications of binary thinking, it is easy to decide that they are conceptually limiting and perhaps oppressive in many scenarios. We might, ironically, decide that binaries are “bad.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In response to this, many thinkers and cultural discourses attempt to move beyond binaries by reframing them as spectrums. A common way of deconstructing a binary is to replace it with a spectrum where the binary is sort of spread out across a linear plane whose endpoints are what were previously the two sides of the binary. By doing this, something can be described as existing not as one of two opposites, but somewhere along a continuous range between them.
 </p>
 <p>
          The problem with this approach is that it still requires the binary to exist in the first place. In order to create a spectrum between two points, those two points must exist. Because of this, any proposed linear spectrum between two opposites is still a binary in most respects. It could be described as maybe a soft binary, or a flexible binary.
</p>
<p>
To say that things are both good <em>and</em> bad, however, is not to say they exist somewhere along a spectrum of good and bad. It&apos;s simply to utilize the fact that the concepts “good” and “bad” refer to something we all intuitively recognize. In Zoomer terms, “good” is sort of just a vibe. 
</p>
<p>
Insisting that each term be explicitly defined before it can be talked about doesn&apos;t deepen anyone&apos;s understanding, and in some ways, doing this seems to undermine, or at least misunderstand, the purpose and function of language. The “true” meanings of words exist exclusively in our collective understanding of those words. Language is fluid, adaptive, and socially informed.
</p>
<p>
It is extremely difficult, and perhaps impossible, to imagine a world without language. Language has such a meaningful impact on our perception of reality that it seems just as likely that reality is shaped entirely by language as it does that our language has developed in response to reality. The two are impossible to untangle. And yet, before language, was the world an undifferentiated blur? Do our pets, who lack language, perceive everything as one continuous field with no boundaries between self and surroundings?
</p>
<p>
To be honest, I don&apos;t know. It is entirely possible that they do, actually. It is an interesting question. Regardless, reality technically remains singular. The purpose of language is to divide reality into pieces so that we can think about it better.
</p>
<p>
A good way to understand this is to compare language to digital colors. In real life, there are infinite colors. Technically, I think. Color exists on a continuous spectrum, and then our eyes and brains interpret wavelengths, lighting conditions, and context. What we call a “color” is not a fixed property but an experience that can vary infinitely, or at least virtually infinitely.
</p>
<p>
Digitally, however, there are not infinite colors. According to a google search I just did, depending on the quality of your screen display you might be able to see anywhere from 16 million to one billion digital colors. A computer simulates the true color spectrum by dividing it into discrete values. These values create the illusion of lighting, perspective, and depth, and our brains fill in the rest. This creates an illusion of continuity even when it is not actually there. 
</p>
<p>
This is exactly what language does with reality. We divide the continuous, seamless whole of existence into discrete pieces and then put them back together. In doing this, a sort of conceptual, second reality emerges. This theoretical world, built entirely out of symbols, both distorts and reflects the original.
</p>
<p>
Here we arrive at a crucial concept: The description of something is not the thing itself. The conceptual existence of an object or idea is only a reference to it, never its true existence.
</p>
<p>
If I claim that the sky is blue, your counterargument shouldn&apos;t depend on redefining “the sky.” Without that shared definition, we’re not even talking about the same thing. But notice how the word “is” already traps us in definition. What does it mean to say something “is” blue? In reality, nothing “is” anything else. When we talk about things, and importantly when we argue with each other about things, we are not talking about those things themselves but a conceptual approximation of them.
</p>
<p>
This is why endlessly asking “what is good?” will eventually collapse under its own recursion. Questions like this misunderstand the relationship between words and reality. To ask what something “really is” assumes that reality actually is divided into discrete parts that have set definitions. It assumes that things are intrinsically separate from one another, and that there are real boundaries between things and other things.
</p>
<p>
The conceptual world created by language, however, is not any less meaningful or important than the real world. In fact, it is the only world we really have access to. It is the only world we can share. Anything that exists in our conceptual world might as well exist in the real world. The way we see reality is our reality, regardless of whatever “true” reality exists beneath our perception of it.
</p>
<p>
I am pointing this out specifically within the context of binaries because although we might be inclined to point out that binaries do not actually exist, the fact of the matter is that they do exist because we have conceived of them. The concept of opposites is crucial to the construction of the English language, and many other languages. Therefore, in our conceptual world, binaries exist.
</p>
<p>
Some words mean, definitionally, the opposite of another word and nothing more. The word “or” itself exists solely to place a hard boundary line between two concepts. Our language, at least, seems completely intertwined with binary thought.
</p>
<p>
Is this a necessary part of language? I don&apos;t know. Probably not, I would say. Are binaries good? Do we need them?
</p>
<p>
I&apos;d imagine that you could easily describe the world in terms of what it is without ever referring to what it is not. I do not see any reason to assume that binary thought emerged out of necessity, or that it was inevitable given the conditions of reality. There are no opposites in nature. 
</p>
<p>
Another problem with binaries is what is commonly referred to as horseshoe theory. It is often the case that opposites seem to resemble each other more than they resemble other things. So what even is an opposite? What is the purpose of this conceptual lens?
</p>
<p>
I don&apos;t actually know. I&apos;ll probably end all of these with a similar sentiment. I am only good at asking questions and being confused. I am bad at generating answers.
</p>
<p>
My prediction is that binaries are directly linked to capitalism, which is directly linked to the transatlantic slave trade. Binary thought gives us a conceptual framework for separation. We can separate self from other, subject versus object, person versus property, etc. It is more convenient, less nuanced, and easier to maintain systems of power when the world is divided into neat categories. A person in a category loses their humanity. They are the category rather than an individual. To say that a human being is anything at all is to say that they are not something else and vice versa. 
</p>
<p>
Importantly, binaries allow us to create false realities where it is not morally reprehensible to knowingly cause suffering. In order to assign monetary value to a thing, it must first be categorized. Capitalism depends on exploitation which depends on dehumanization. Binary thought allows us to cognitively separate ourselves from the suffering of others, creating the ideal conditions for exploitation.
</p>
<p>
So are binaries bad? I think so, yes. I understand that in order to answer that question I had to think in terms of binaries. But when I say &quot;bad&quot; here, I mean &quot;causing harm,&quot; &quot;lazy,&quot; &quot;antithetical to human progress,&quot; or any other similar term you&apos;d like to substitute. I do not mean bad as in &quot;opposite of good.&quot;
</p>
<p>
My intention when I decided to write about why things are good and bad was to discover nuance. It is a good exercise against binary thinking to force both ends of a binary onto something. If two opposites both apply, the binary dissolves. It is no longer relevant. It does not explain anything. I am still using the terms because they mean something within our current conceptual reality. So I will attempt with each topic to generate reasons why things are both “good” and “bad.”
</p>
<p>
So how are binaries good? I don&apos;t know that I can say with any evidence that they are morally good, but if we replace “good” with “useful” or “advantageous for survival” we can generate some answers to the question.
</p>
<p>
Our brains evolved to categorize for survival reasons. In a life-threatening situation, a predetermined categorization could be life saving. I know that snakes, for example, are long and scaly and generally look like snakes. Some things that are not snakes may be quickly categorized as snakes by my brain if they meet this criteria. This is because if I were to encounter a snake and have no understanding of what a snake was or the fact that snakes can be deadly, I might not react accordingly, and could die. In the snake example, being able to quickly identify whether or not something is a snake translates directly to being able to quickly identify whether or not something is dangerous. Dangerous versus safe is a very important binary for survival. 
</p>
<p>
It is easy to see how quick survival decisions could have led to binary language. In a group of people, saying “dangerous” out loud is much quicker than saying “I see a long scaly creature that looks like something I know killed someone recently” which might take too long to communicate before someone died via snake bite. But is this really the same type of binary as right versus wrong? I don&apos;t know. 
</p>
<p>
It sort of seems like binaries become problematic when we apply them to non-survival situations. I want to clarify that I do not believe that evolutionary survival mechanisms are an adequate defense of any human behavior outside of survival situations. We have specifically distinguished ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom because of our ability for language and complex moral reasoning. If it is true that we are different from other animals in this way, we can almost never defend our actions by appealing to natural instincts or evolution. We have created new systems of meaning outside of what was once natural, and it is our responsibility to adjust those systems if they cause harm. Plus, humans also evolved to have the reasoning capabilities to resolve problems in a nonviolent way. So this argument can typically be turned on itself. But I digress. 
</p>
<p>
I actually think that applying a binary to binary thought is harmful in the same way that binaries are. There are many useful applications of binaries. It is just as stupid to say “binaries are bad and we shouldn&apos;t use them” as it is to argue for binaries on the premise of their evolutionary advantage. 
</p>
<p>
I have reached the point, unfortunately, that I feared I would when coming up with the idea to decide in what ways things were good and bad. There are too many things. There are too many angles and too many perspectives and many things can be true at once. I have no answer. I do not know. 
</p>
<p>
Thinking for the sake of thinking is good though! There does not have to be an answer or a conclusion or any point to doing anything! Living by this is one of the ways you can rebel against capitalism in everyday life. You can think for a long time and never come to any conclusion and decide not to consider the time you spent thinking wasted. You can think of new ways to think about things for fun and for no reason at all. It is my opinion that thought itself is intrinsically valuable and therefore needs no justification or outcome. Maybe next I will do “why thinking is good and bad.” 
</p>
<p>
I think that is all I have to say as we are reaching a point of no return. I am not necessarily pleased with it as I did not answer any questions regarding any of the questions I presented in the beginning, nor do I feel any closer to them. That was to be expected. I have very debilitating and severe obsessive compulsive disorder. I am clinically insane. Etcetera. But at least I finished something!
