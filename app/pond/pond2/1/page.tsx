           I thought that this would be an appropriate and fun starting point for &quot;Why Things are Good and Bad,&quot; as this title invokes probably the most recognizable and widely used binary.
         </p>     
	<p>
           Since this is the first Why Things are Good and Bad (WTAGB) page, and because there are so many variations of the good/bad binary, I will start by specifically clarifying what I mean by &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad.&quot;
        </p>
       <p>
           Firstly, note that here, things are good AND bad as opposed to being good OR bad.
	</p>


	<p>
           I do not believe that anything is purely good or purely bad, except (one could argue) that the concepts of pure goodness and pure badness are definitionally and therefore necessarily purely good and purely bad. Sure. 
        </p>
	<p> 
After enough thinking about the implications of binary thinking, it is easy to decide that they are conceptually limiting and perhaps oppressive in many scenarios. We might, ironically, decide that binaries are “bad.” 
         </p>
         <p>
           In response to this, many thinkers and cultural discourses attempt to move beyond binaries by reframing them as spectrums. A common way of deconstructing a binary is to replace it with a spectrum where the binary is sort of spread out across a linear plane whose endpoints are what was previously the two sides of the binary. By doing this, something can be described as existing not as one of two opposites, but somewhere along a continuous range between them. 
	</p>
	<p>
           The problem with this approach is that it still requires the binary to exist in the first place. In order to create a spectrum between two points, those two points must exist. Because of this, any proposed linear spectrum between two opposites is still a binary in many respects. It could be described as maybe a soft binary, or a flexible binary.
</p>
<p>
To say that things are both good <em>and</em> bad, however, is not to say they exist somewhere along a spectrum of good and bad. It&apos;s simply to utilize the fact that the concepts “good” and “bad” refer to something we all intuitively recognize. 
</p>
<p>
Insisting that each term be explicitly defined before it can be talked about doesn&apos;t deepen anyone&apos;s understanding, and in some ways, doing this seems to undermine, or at least misunderstand, the purpose and function of language. The “true” meanings of words exist exclusively in our collective understanding of those words. Language is fluid, adaptive, and socially informed. 
</p>
<p>
It is extremely difficult, and perhaps impossible, to imagine a world without language. Language has such a meaningful impact on our perception of reality that it seems just as likely that reality is shaped entirely by language as it does that our language has developed in response to reality. The two are impossible to untangle. And yet, before language, was the world an undifferentiated blur? Do our pets, who lack language, perceive everything as one continuous field with no boundaries between self and surroundings?
</p>
<p>
To be honest, I don&apos;t know. It is entirely possible that they do, actually. It is an interesting question. Regardless, reality technically remains singular. The purpose of language is to divide reality into pieces so that we can understand it better. 
</p>
<p>
A good way to understand this is to compare language to digital colors. In real life, there are infinite colors. Technically, I think. Color exists on a continuous spectrum, and then our eyes and brains interpret wavelengths, lighting conditions, and context. What we call a “color” is not a fixed property but an experience that can vary infinitely, or at least virtually infinitely. 
</p>
<p>
Digitally, however, there are not infinite colors. According to a google search I just did, depending on the quality of your screen display, you might be able to see anywhere from 16 million to one billion digital colors. A computer simulates the true color spectrum by dividing it into discrete values. These values create the illusion of lighting, perspective, and depth, and our brains fill in the rest. This creates the illusion of continuity even when it is not actually there.  
</p>
<p>
This is exactly what language does with reality. We divide the continuous, seamless whole of existence into discrete pieces, and then put them back together. In doing this, a sort of conceptual, second reality emerges. This theoretical world, built entirely from symbols, both distorts and reflects the original. 
</p>
<p>
Here we arrive at a crucial concept: The description of something is not the thing itself. The conceptual existence of an object or idea is only a reference to it, never its true existence. 
</p>
<p>
If I claim that the sky is blue, your counterargument shouldn&apos;t depend on redefining “the sky.” Without that shared definition, we’re not even talking about the same thing. But notice how the word “is” already traps us in definition. What does it mean to say something “is” blue? In reality, nothing “is” anything else. When we talk about things, and importantly when we argue with each other about things, we are not talking about those things themselves but a conceptual approximation of them. 
</p>
<p>
This is why endlessly asking “what is good?” will eventually collapse under its own recursion. Questions like this misunderstand the relationship between words and reality. To ask what something “really is” assumes that reality actually is divided into discrete parts that have set definitions. It assumes that things are actually intrinsically separate from one another, and that there are real boundaries between things and other things. 
</p>
<p>
The conceptual world created by language, however, is not any less meaningful or important than the real world. In fact, it is the only world we really have access to. It is the only world we can share. Anything that exists in our conceptual world might as well exist in the real world. The way we see reality is our reality, regardless of whatever “true” reality exists beneath our perception of it. 
</p>
<p>
I am pointing this out specifically within the context of binaries because although we might be inclined to point out that binaries do not actually exist, the fact of the matter is that they do exist because we have conceived of them. The concept of opposites is crucial to the construction of the English language, and many other languages. Therefore, in our conceptual world, binaries exist.
</p>
<p>
Some words mean, definitionally, the opposite of another word and nothing more. The word “or” itself exists solely to place a hard boundary line between two concepts. Our language, at least, seems completely intertwined with binary thought. 
</p>
<p>
Is this a necessary part of language? I don&apos;t know. Probably not, I would say. Are binaries good? Do we need them?
</p>
<p>
I&apos;d imagine that you could easily describe the world in terms of what it is without ever referring to what it is not. I do not see any reason to assume that binary thought emerged out of necessity. 
</p>
<p>
Another problem with binaries is what is commonly referred to as horseshoe theory. It is often the case that opposites seem to resemble each other more than they resemble other things. So what even is an opposite? What is the purpose of this conceptual lens? 
</p>
<p>
I don&apos;t actually know. I&apos;ll probably end all of these with a similar sentiment. I am only good at asking questions and being confused. I am bad at generating answers.
</p>
<p>
My prediction is that binaries are directly linked to capitalism, which is directly linked to the trans-atlantic slave trade. It is a way to separate “self” from “other.” It is more convenient, less nuanced, and generally easier to see the world in terms of division and categories.
 </p>
<p>
Importantly, binaries allow us to create false realities where it is not morally reprehensible to knowingly cause suffering. Capitalism began with and requires exploitation to continue. Exploitation requires dehumanization. And binary thought allows us to cognitively separate ourselves from the suffering of others. This creates the ideal conditions for exploitation. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway! I think that is all I have to say about this for now. That was a lot to think about! I will probably have more ideas later and I will add them to this. For now I think I will actually finish something and put it in the pond! Goodbye.
