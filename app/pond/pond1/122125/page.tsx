Good afternoon, pebble world. I am currently sitting in the passenger seat of a car and have been for a very long time. I have sort of abandoned pebble world and have been working on a new private coding project that no one will ever see ever. It is very healing to do this.
          </p>
          <p>
I also started pebble world when I was worse at coding and unfortunately it is hard to go back and change files once they have been made. The formatting and general efficiency of this website is sort of stuck where it is at now, and it is very annoying. I do not like inefficiency, as you may know. But I am committed, as an OCD exercise I suppose (something I am not working on in any other way lol) to continuing to add and change this website in particular. Mostly because I told myself that I would. I do not like not doing things I said I would do, even if information or circumstances change and it no longer makes sense. So in some ways I suppose I am just caving to a different OCD thing. I will never escape that and I think it is best to just stop thinking about it. I am what I am.
          </p>
          <p>
I suppose what I want to discuss is in line with mental health sort of, just not OCD because I cannot fix that and am not ready to try to figure it out. I have been thinking a lot about my own personal insanity which exists in its own special category of mental illness that the DSM has not covered yet. I think a lot of people have this type of insanity, the DSM is just bad. Anti-solipsism reminder.

Actually, sorry, speaking of which, we are going to do a quick anti-solipsism recap. I still have not published that because it is not perfect yet. These pages do not have to be perfect but that one is something I actually care about and actually tried to do well so I cannot post it until it is complete. But to summarize, anti-solipsism. Just know. Ok lets move on.          </p>
          <p>
I have now seen rural Massachusetts and New York City. I saw snow fall for the first time and it was beautiful and I loved it so much. I have gone on several trips this year that have opened my eyes to the fact that the environment I live in currently is not condusive to mental stability in any way. This was confirmed to me when I entered NYC and felt the same way I do in LA. I do not like noise and I really like trees. Something I realized about trees recently is that they cover up the sun. So when an environment has trees, it is less bright. Only in the fucking desert are you supposed to recieve the full force of the Sun. It is too bright in LA. It is too loud and too bright and too gray. I do not like these things. But can I blame all of my insanity on that alone? Well no, lol. I guess that is what I want to talk about.
          </p>
While I do not feel like getting into the origins of my insanity or its categorization I do feel that it should be discussed openly. This is a me discussing openly things that are wrong with me post. Sorry if it is cold and dead and lacking in emotional language. That is a bad habit of mine. I am just like that and I talk like that. But I am a human being with feelings and sadness and shame. Believe it or not.           
          <p>
First of all, I have autism. That is not one of the diagnoses I am at odds with. I understand that I am autistic, I just do not really care or think that it explains much. The problem with autism is that it explains almost nothing about the internal experience of the autistic person. I think this is because we all think differently. All the autistic people I know have their own unique brains that are not only different from the normal brain but are different from the other autistic brains. I think this makes it difficult to get a good understanding of our collective experience. I know my autism, and I do not really care whether or not it is autism. To me it is just my brain. The autism label just reminds me why people do not think I am normal which is external. So whatever. 
          </p>
          <p>
Anyway, I think I have the drama kind of autism which is why I am so insane. I am not a doctor!!!!!!!!!! These are just my unprofessional observations. But there seems to be a variety of autism that manifests as extreme sensitivity to almost everything and I understand that to be what is wrong with me. Unfortunately I hate that about myself which manifests as my avoidance of emotional language in all areas of life. So I am at a place where all of my insanity is trapped inside and I cannot talk about it. I can only dance around it and observe it through some sort of pseudoclinical lens. I think most of my thinking is emotional avoidance. I hate thinking so much but before I did that I was always feeling things which is much worse. I chose this at some point and will continue to. Maybe it was not a real choice and I did not really have agency but that is not the way I am choosing to view it. I like to believe I have agency.        </p>
          <p>
But anyway, being overly sensitive is debilitating even if I avoid expressing it. Possibly because I have avoided expressing it. But I was debilitated as a child so I imagine I would still be regardless of how I had responded. Now I choose to think. And sometimes when I think about it, I feel more insane than I am.           </p>
          <p>
Sometimes people get really triggered by my claims to insanity because I am clearly capable of rational thought and can explain to you that I am insane. You are stupid if you are in this category of person. I can only warn people so many times. I try so hard to convey that I am not just smart and unique! but also insane. I do this whenever I meet anyone. I try to get this point across every single time I get close to another person and for some reason no one ever believes me until I present as insane. And at this point everyone is always very shocked and confused. This frustrates me.          </p>            
          <p>
So I guess in some ways this website is an expression of my insanity which is why it has been so difficult for me to reel in. I like it, but it is hard to look at and engage with. I do not know what it is. I do not remember what I meant originally by Pebble World. That name holds no meaning to me anymore. I always think things and then they go away. My brain now is not my brain later and it is not my brain in the past. Sometimes I read things I wrote six months ago and think I have lost like 30 percent of my intellect. But I have been doing that for years. I have no idea what I am or how to fix it or if fixing it is even necessary or possible. Maybe it is all just the environment. But with that aside, why am I not allowed to tell people I am insane? Why does everyone insist on forcing me to show them. I am still sensitive, it still does hurt my feelings. I do care what people think. Maybe that is not coming across because of the cold deadness in my communication but from my position I am explaining everything as accurately as I possibly can. What more should I be doing? Whatever.           </p>
       <p>
        I guess I have no point. Normal for me. Failed at anti-solipsism BADLY in this post. Despite my preface. I really need to publish that. I am going to stop writing now because I actually do feel that I am too beyond scattered to even put together a full sentence without forgetting what I was saying partway through. But I am still going to publish it. I am going to do it anyway. Ok, goodbye. </p> </div>
