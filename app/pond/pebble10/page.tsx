        Anti-solipsism rules!
      </h1>
      <p>
        this is my personal list of anti-solipsism rules (or affirmations, or
        whatever you would like to refer to them as). They are designed to save
        grown up savant toddlers from being insufferable people later in life.
        reform is possible. it is also necessary if you want to be happy and
        normal.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1. everyone you meet knows more than you about at least one thing, but
          probably many things. 
        </li>
        <li>
          2. you do not know anything, and you are probably at least partially
          wrong about most of the things you are currently certain of.
        </li>
        <li>3. intelligence is not an inherently positive quality.</li>
        <li>
          4. there are people like you. there are almost 8 billion people on
          earth and many of them are exactly like you. (this does not have to be true, you are telling yourself that it is)
        </li>
        <li>
          5. you do not need to talk basically ever and no one cares what you
          are thinking. (also does not have to be true, it is an affirmation not a truth)
        </li>
        <li>
          6. you should constantly be aware of your negative qualities and be
          working to fix them. 
        </li>
        <li>7. you are bad at everything you think you are good at. (again, affirmation not truth, it is good for you to think this)</li>
        <li>
          8. assume your thoughts are the least important in the room at all
          times. 
        </li>
        <li>
          9. you have no additional responsibility to do anything for the world
          or other people because of any special skill you have been told you have. you have the same responsibility as everyone else. your failures mean the same as everyone else.
        </li>
        <li>
          10. it is not mature or positive in any way to take everything
          extremely seriously. nothing is serious. and thats an annoying
          quality. everyone who is being less serious than you is happier than
          you. (again not necessarily factual but think it anyway)
        </li>
        <li>
          11. being negative is not a sign of intelligence. people who are
          positive are not stupider than you. consider that you are just
          negative and bitter. 
        </li>
        <li>
          12. practice being friends with yourself if you feel like you have no friends. you can split yourself into two or three or four even and you will no longer feel like the only person on earth. this is if nothing else works, and do not do it often. 
        </li>
        <li>
          13. go outside and look at trees and flowers and be happy about their
          existence. do things that children do. you are not serious. do you
          want to die knowing you took yourself this seriously for your entire
          life? 
        </li>
        <li>14. keep many of your good thoughts to yourself. this is so you can know that you are doing this, and that its possible others, and maybe even all others, are also doing this. tell yourself that all people do this. if it seems like no one is thinking anything, it can be because they are keeping many of their good thoughts to themselves. just like you. are you seeing this?</li>
<li>15. do not befriend, date, or closely associate yourself with people who declare that you and them are part of some sort of elite group. if someone thinks this way it should be kept private. these people will never be your friends because they will only ever want to compete with you. there is no elite group, and if there is, they are not saying things like this out loud and to random people. everyone dies at the end and this is stupid.</li>
<li>16. remember that people tell themselves things that are not true all the time. you can also do this. take advantage of the fact that you can never be truly certain of anything.</li>
<li>17. have projects for yourself. have things you never share with anyone. you may be thinking this encourages solipsism. it does not. you are doing this so you have proof that at least some people (you) are doing this. then assume everyone else is. how would you know?</li>
<li>18. lastly, have projects that are technically just for you but that you share with other people. do this in a way that makes it unlikely that anyone will actually discuss anything about the project with uou in real life. assume everyone is on the same page as you and you are speaking to the private thoughts of everyone. do not share it publicly or on social media though, because you might fall victim to thinking that since you have never seen anyone else do that, they are not doing it. assume they are. </li>
      </ul>
<p>You do not have to take the anti-solipsism route. I am not saying this is what you have to do. you are welcome to believe whatever you would like to believe. As far as I have seen in my long life of 23 years (which in all fairness is very little) you have two options: lie to yourself to become happier or lie to yourself to further an identity placed on you in childhood that has nothing to do with you now and makes you miserable and lonely. if you want to chase glory, you should do that. but if you dont think that anyone else is like you, or thinking at all, what does it matter if you achieve it? Who will be watching that matters to you? I dont believe there is anything for you at the end of that journey, and if there is it will not make you any less lonely. You are also easily manipulated in this state unless you commit to being a manipulator yourself. if you have told yourself that is the only option, you are wrong. choose it and make sure you know that it is a choice. no one is forcing you to identify with being special. I am not even saying that after enough time being alive I will succeed in taking the anti-solipsism route. it is a lifelong battle. but you will be happier, I promise.
