        Anti-Solipsism Rules!
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is my personal list of anti-solipsism rules (or affirmations, or
        whatever you would like to refer to them as). They are designed to save
        grown-up savant toddlers from becoming insufferable people later in life.
        Reform is possible. It is also necessary if you want to be happy and
        normal.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1. Everyone you meet knows more than you about at least one thing—but
          probably many things.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. You do not know anything, and you are probably at least partially
          wrong about most of the things you are currently certain of.
        </li>
        <li>3. Intelligence is not an inherently positive quality.</li>
        <li>
          4. There are people like you. There are almost 8 billion people on
          Earth, and many of them are exactly like you. (This does not have to be true; you are telling yourself that it is.)
        </li>
        <li>
          5. You do not need to talk—basically ever—and no one cares what you
          are thinking. (Also does not have to be true; it is an affirmation, not a truth.)
        </li>
        <li>
          6. You should constantly be aware of your negative qualities and be
          working to fix them.
        </li>
        <li>
          7. You are bad at everything you think you are good at. (Again,
          affirmation, not truth. It is good for you to think this.)
        </li>
        <li>
          8. Assume your thoughts are the least important in the room at all
          times.
        </li>
        <li>
          9. You have no additional responsibility to do anything for the world
          or other people because of any special skill you have been told you
          have. You have the same responsibility as everyone else. Your failures
          mean the same as everyone else’s.
        </li>
        <li>
          10. It is not mature or positive in any way to take everything
          extremely seriously. Nothing is serious—and that’s an annoying
          quality. Everyone who is being less serious than you is happier than
          you. (Again, not necessarily factual, but think it anyway.)
        </li>
        <li>
          11. Being negative is not a sign of intelligence. People who are
          positive are not stupider than you. Consider that you are just
          negative and bitter.
        </li>
        <li>
          12. Practice being friends with yourself if you feel like you have no
          friends. You can split yourself into two or three or four, even, and
          you will no longer feel like the only person on Earth. This is if
          nothing else works, and do not do it often.
        </li>
        <li>
          13. Go outside and look at trees and flowers and be happy about their
          existence. Do things that children do. You are not serious. Do you
          want to die knowing you took yourself this seriously your entire
          life?
        </li>
        <li>
          14. Keep many of your good thoughts to yourself. This is so you can
          know that you are doing this, and that it’s possible others—and maybe
          even all others—are also doing this. Tell yourself that all people do
          this. If it seems like no one is thinking anything, it can be because
          they are keeping many of their good thoughts to themselves, just like
          you. Are you seeing this?
        </li>
        <li>
          15. Do not befriend, date, or closely associate yourself with people
          who declare that you and they are part of some sort of elite group. If
          someone thinks this way, it should be kept private. These people will
          never be your friends because they will only ever want to compete with
          you. There is no elite group, and if there is, they are not saying
          things like this out loud to random people. Everyone dies at the end,
          and this is stupid.
        </li>
        <li>
          16. Remember that people tell themselves things that are not true all
          the time. You can also do this. Take advantage of the fact that you
          can never be truly certain of anything.
        </li>
        <li>
          17. Have projects for yourself. Have things you never share with
          anyone. You may be thinking this encourages solipsism. It does not.
          You are doing this so you have proof that at least some people (you)
          are doing this. Then assume everyone else is. How would you know?
        </li>
        <li>
          18. Lastly, have projects that are technically just for you but that
          you share with other people. Do this in a way that makes it unlikely
          that anyone will actually discuss anything about the project with you
          in real life. Assume everyone is on the same page as you and you are
          speaking to the private thoughts of everyone. Do not share it publicly
          or on social media, though, because you might fall victim to thinking
          that since you have never seen anyone else do that, they are not doing
          it. Assume they are.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You do not have to take the anti-solipsism route. I am not saying this
        is what you have to do. You are welcome to believe whatever you would
        like to believe. As far as I have seen in my long life of 23 years
        (which, in all fairness, is very little), you have two options: lie to
        yourself to become happier, or lie to yourself to further an identity
        placed on you in childhood that has nothing to do with you now and makes
        you miserable and lonely. If you want to chase glory, you should do
        that. But if you don’t think that anyone else is like you, or thinking
        at all, what does it matter if you achieve it? Who will be watching that
        matters to you? I don’t believe there is anything for you at the end of
        that journey, and if there is, it will not make you any less lonely. You
        are also easily manipulated in this state unless you commit to being a
        manipulator yourself. If you have told yourself that is the only option,
        you are wrong. Choose it, and make sure you know that it is a choice. No
        one is forcing you to identify with being special. I am not even saying
        that after enough time being alive I will succeed in taking the
        anti-solipsism route. It is a lifelong battle. But you will be happier,
        I promise.
